                        <p>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (born 24 April 1973) is an former international cricketer and former captain of the Indian national team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of men's cricket. He is
                            the highest run scorer of all time in International cricket. Sachin Tendulkar is the leading run scorer in Tests, with 15,921 runs, as well as in One-Day Internationals, with 18,426 runs. <br><br> He is the only player to
